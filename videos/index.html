Starting with a clean yet completely imperative code base written in Java, In this video, Codurance co-founder Sandro Mancuso will explain how to improve code by applying functional principles, primarily extracting functions as objects and passing them around.</p> <p>He will be pointing out how each refactor simplifies the code according to one or more of the four rules.</p> <p>He will start by removing duplication, even where duplication isn’t apparent from an OO point of view, before making the code clearer by replacing the language of the system by the language of our domain. Along the way, he'll reduce the number of moving parts and increase test coverage.</p> <p>He will also explain how existing libraries in Java and C# can help you refactor your own code to be smaller and more understandable.</p> </div> </div> <!--end of 4 Rules of simple design--> <!--Functional Programming OO video--> <div class="news-v3 margin-bottom-30 bg-color-white"> <img class="img-responsive full-width"> <iframe style="height: 400px; width: 100%;" src="//www.parleys.com/share.html#play/51aa0172e4b01033a7e4b67a"></iframe> </img> <div class="news-v3-in"> <ul class="list-inline posted-info"> <li>Posted 26 Mar 2013 - Devoxx UK - London, UK</li> </ul> <h2>Functional Programming is cool, but do you know OO?</h2> <p>Functional programming is becoming more and more popular, and for good reasons, but now a big number of developers are bashing Object Oriented Programming. However, how much do we really know about Object Oriented Programming? Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism is OOP for kids. In this talk Sandro will be explaining many OOP/OOD principles and practices that every developer should always have in their minds before writing any line of code.

Our objective is to write tests for it and then refactor to make it better. The code has the most common problems that much larger legacy applications have, like Singletons, static calls and feature envy. It also has some design problems. Fixing that is quite hard, mainly when we need to write all the tests before we start the refactoring. Another rule: We cannot change production code if it is not covered by tests but quite often we need to change the production code in order to be able to test it. How to solve this problem? Well, I hope I can answer all these questions in this video. <p>If you want to play with the code, clone it from <a href="https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata">Sandro's Github repository</a></p> </div> </div> <!--End of testing and refactoring screncast video--> <!--UGtastic Interviews Sandro Mancuso video--> <div class="news-v3 margin-bottom-30 bg-color-white"> <img class="img-responsive full-width"> <iframe style="height: 400px; width: 100%;" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/54327320?color=ffffff"></iframe> </img> <div class="news-v3-in"> <ul class="list-inline posted-info"> <li>Posted Dec 2012 - Chicago, USA</li> </ul> <h2>UGtastic Interviews Sandro Mancuso</h2> <p>In this interview Codurance co-founder Sandro Mancuso talks Software Craftsmanship communities in London and Europe.</p> </div> </div> <!--end of UGtastic video--> <!--Last Video--> <div class="news-v3 margin-bottom-30 bg-color-white"> <img class="img-responsive full-width"> <iframe style="height: 400px; width: 100%;" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/44243846"></iframe> </img> <div class="news-v3-in"> <ul class="list-inline posted-info"> <li>Posted 13 Jun 2012 - Agile Central Europe (ACE) - Krakow, Poland</li> </ul> <h2>Curing Agile Hangover with Craftsmanship</h2> <p>Agile adoption brings into focus the shortcomings in the existing engineering practices. After undergoing an Agile transformation for a few years at UBS, where the focus was heavy on process and light on the technical disciplines, it is an understatement to say that we still have problems. We call this the Agile Hangover. Focusing on the technical practices is essential to a successful software project, regardless of the process. Software Craftsmanship principles have been essential in tackling the problems we face.</p> <p>In this talk we will share our experiences in how we are trying to find the right balance between technical practices and processes. Empowered professional software engineers, well defined testing strategy, process automation, high investment in people development, requirements management and strong emphasis on quality have been the key areas our focus.</p> </div> </div> <!--End of Last Video--> </div> <!-- left sidebar ends --> <!-- right sidebar --> <div class="col-md-3"> <div class="posts margin-bottom-40"> <div
